# To_Do_List
A simple console-based application built using Python that helps users manage tasks. The program allows users to:

1.View all tasks with their completion status.
2.Add new tasks.
3.Mark tasks as completed.
4.Delete tasks from the list.

The application uses a text-based menu for interaction, making it easy to navigate and manage tasks directly from the terminal. This project demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and list management.
